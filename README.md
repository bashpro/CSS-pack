# CSS-pack
Making of a CSS pack using a cutting edge design and producing different style templates.

# The idea
I want to collaborate with anyone who wants to make a CSS pack. The CSS pack is going to have 3 styles of framework and will be responsive, with a material design feel or as its known as cutting edge look.

I will be posting ver 0.1 of the css pack once ive finished all the framework i think is complete, and id like to develop on them to produce a more refound css pack which is easy to use and works quickly.

# What I need

The help I need the most is with Javascript/jquery to create some intresting features such as simple drop down menues and div changes like adding a new class when someone hovers over something or even changing a div's appearance.

I'd also like help with new additional features which we can add to this CSS pack.

Anyone good at finding mistakes or bug fixes would help.
